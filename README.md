# React + TypeScript + MUI

Getting Started:

1. clone this repository
2. git switch -c [whatever name you want to name your local branch] origin/test
3. npm i
4. npm run dev

**Saving changes:**

git add . 

git commit . -m [WHAT I DID]

**When pushing (uploading changes to repo) for the first time:**

git push --set-upstream origin test

**Pushing In General**

git push origin [name_of_your_branch if needed (some machines)]

Notes: whenever someone makes a change to the repo, you will have to   git pull  if you want those changes.
If you want to just refresh the state, do: git fetch
